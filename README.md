# Sightline 
A turn-based multiplayer strategy prototype with a modern military theme, built in Godot 4.

# Overview
**Sightline** is a prototype of a modern military-themed, turn-based multiplayer strategy game developed entirely in my free time as a personal hobby project. 
The main goal behind the project was to explore and learn the process of building larger-scale games - particularly focusing on networking, multiplayer systems, and working within the Godot 4 engine.

While the game is incomplete and relatively bare in terms of content and polish, it is fully playable and supports both local and non-local multiplayer. 
It features a functional turn system & team systems, unit mechanics, fully-featured RTS-style camera and a tile-based map with line-of-sight considerations.
